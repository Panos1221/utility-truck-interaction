# Utility Truck Interactions: Control utility truck buckets in GTA V
## Created by PNWParksFan

This is a RagePluginHook plugin for single-player GTA V. 
It enables players to move the bucket on utility trucks up/down and rotate using simple controls.

To use the plugin, copy the DLL and INI files to your `Plugins` folder, load the plugin using RPH, and 
approach any vehicle with a utility bucket. You will be prompted to press and hold a key (default `X` on 
keyboard) to enable control of the vehicle, and will then be prompted with the controls to maneuver the bucket.

This script automatically detects and works with any vehicle with the required bones. However, some 
functionality may not work as expected if the relative position of the relevant dummies has not been retained. 
The recommended approach is to import the default `utillitruck` model and copy over the exact dummy positions 
for the following bones: `rotating_base`, `arm_1`, `arm_2`, `bucket`. 

If you create a utility truck model intended for use with this mod, please consider linking to this mod in 
your readme or credits file, and link to this page. Feel free to send me a link to your mod when it's released
